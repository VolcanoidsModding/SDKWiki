# Welcome!
We're glad you're here! These Docs are the reference for the [Volcanoids Modding SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VolcanoidsSDK/) by MelodicAlbuild and LordGregory.

These docs are just a reference for the Modding SDK that include what each function is and how it works. However this is only going to
expose the main function set in `VolcanoidsSDK.Functions` further docs will be created when there is better in code documentation for
the `VolcanoidsSDK.lib.*` function set and Class Set. The only exception to this is the `VolcanoidsSDK.lib.classes.*` which will be exposed in these docs.

All the Docs will be in their categories based on the Namespace they are in.
